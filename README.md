# Inovola-angular-task
- To start the project in the first time please run 
- npm install
- npm start

# Files to check
- Check the helpers folder to see how JWT works in our project
- Check State folder to see how we are managing the suborinates state.
- Check Authentication.service.ts to track login and setting user token to all upcoming requests.

# notes:
 - I have added a "logout()" function in the header to make you able to test Login and interceptor 
 - The project includes three modules "shared module", "user module" and "profile module" to make the best use of "lazy loading" methodology.
 - If you need to change the api link you can find it in the environment varibles.
